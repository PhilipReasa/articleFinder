          <h3 class="entry-title">Probity – About the Name</h3>
          <h4 class="vcard author">by <span class="fn">Phil</span></h4>
          <div class="entry-content">
              <p>I am not particularly skilled with words, or a great orator, however I do greatly admire those who are. The power of using the right word at the right time has always impressed me. When I was searching for a name for my company I wanted to make sure that I was choosing the right word. I&nbsp;had two&nbsp;goals that I was hoping the company name would achieve: &nbsp;I wanted to (1) choose a name&nbsp;that had existing meaning already given to it so that I&nbsp;could use that meaning as a guide. I also wanted to, somewhat&nbsp;paradoxically, (2) choose a name that was not already&nbsp;defined in the mind of the public.</p>
<p>I think that the name “Google” is a good example of what I wanted to do. A ‘google’ is actually a number – a 1 with 100 zeros after it. This word fit the first criteria&nbsp;as it had meaning before the company came about. It was a very large number. At the same time, the word ‘google’ really didn’t mean anything to the non mathematicians, meeting the second criteria.&nbsp;Google had the chance to show us what ‘google’ was. It was an incredible amount of information.&nbsp;It has been able to give flesh to an abstract concept.</p>
<p>That is what I was hoping to do when I looked for a name. I wanted a vessel that I could fill up with meaning. The obvious question that I had to ask myself was “what meaning do you want to provide?”&nbsp;The initial word I decided on was integrity. My&nbsp;end goal of running a business was having the opportunity to show others what integrity means to me. Challengingly, most people already have a pretty solid idea of what integrity means to them. Not only does this&nbsp;get in my way of choosing a word that I got to define to people&nbsp;(see point 2), but I am also not enamored with the standard idea of integrity.</p>
<p>My perception is that we tend to define integrity more as something that we want to preserve, than something that we want to bolster. My personal passion is not to “avoid compromising my integrity,” but rather to pursue integrity with vicious desire. That is how I landed on the word ‘Probity.’ Probity is defined as&nbsp;“being of highest moral character,” a definition that can be found just as easily underneath the word integrity.&nbsp;Technically they are remarkably similar words, but I hope to add nuance to probity that is far from present in integrity. I hope that after working with Probity Technology you will see probity as a quality of truthfulness that cannot happen on accident. I hope that you will recognize probity does not allow commitments to be&nbsp;made flippantly, and that probity enforces both the&nbsp;letter and spirit of the law. I hope that you see probity not as something that you have to maintain, but as something that you seek to achieve.</p>
<p>In the end, however, I get no closer to my goal by stating what I hope to do – I must do it.</p>
